WORKING PAPER

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The target continues rotating, it cannot always be seen, it absorbs energy as it
moves. When I look for it I can find it -- so can anyone else!. It frequents
this planet although it did not originate here. There is not any life on it.

[[2]]

The purpose of this object is to gatherr information. It is like a sponge. It
gathers information of every kind in a way that I cannot explain. When I am next
to it I feel vibration -- the hair on my arms stands up and the fluid of my body
vibrates quickly and steadily. When I am on the inside of the object (in the
center of the hollow spot) I cannot breath, I have the AI of suffocation and
pressure.

I followed the object as it made several passes around the planet -- it just
kept absorbing. When it was done, it moved away slowly did not return.

This thing comes form another place. It is here in place of something else.
Again it's purpose is to gather and report. Self sufficient, simple and very
accurate! Programmed -- no mind of it's own.
